Problem
====================

1. Show proper error at each point in the frontend
2. Give some instructions in prompt not to write anything else other than related content
3. 




Security issues
======================
1. getCSPDirectives has 'unsafe-inline', which is ricky. To avoid this, we have to remove it, but then external resources link jquery are not loading then.
So we have to remove the inline css and js from the code. I think we may have very few. we have to check.
