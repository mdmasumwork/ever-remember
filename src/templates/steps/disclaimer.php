    <p>In a moment, you’ll be able to share what you’d like me to help you write. However, I want to make you aware of my limitations.</p>
    <p>My suggestions may not always perfectly capture your thoughts, and I may make mistakes. Please take a moment to review what I write to ensure it truly reflects your memories and feelings.</p>
    <p>Additionally, my suggestions are not a substitute for professional advice. If you need bereavement support or care, I encourage you to seek help from a qualified professional.</p>
